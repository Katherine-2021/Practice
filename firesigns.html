<h1>The Fire Signs- Aries, Leo, Sagittarius</h1>
<p> I  love fire signs, I am a bit jealous them because they are confident and act cool. (don't deny it) Traits of fire signs generally include: passion, creativity, spontaneity, and competitive spirit. </p>

<p2> Aries- generally, I really like Aries because they are passionate and love to live life to the fullest. I admire how they always have energy and will spotaneously do something. Aries are great people to do difficult things with, they are very headstrong, courageous, and not afraid to speak up. The one thing I don't like about Aries is that they can be too competitive, get angry too easily, or they can be insensitive.<p2>
<p3> Leo- You guys are strong, charismatic, and brave, similar to lions. You are also very warm and loving. I love leos! (it depends though) You are also often an incredibly good natural leader. And while you are by far one of my favorite signs, you can be self obsessed and desperate for attention sometimes, which is a big flaw, especially as a person of the people.  
<p4> Sagittarius- You make people laugh, are crazy in a good/bad way, and are extreme fun seekers. Sagittariuses are the best to bring to large events or to hang out with, you are great with large groups but also in small ones too. Additionally, you guys are nice to talk to, you are approachable/friendly. A flaw is that soemtimes you can be very inconsistent or unreliable, whether that is in relationships, school, mood, etc, and some of you are crazy. <p4>

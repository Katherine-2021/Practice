<h1>The Fire Signs- Aries, Leo, Sagittarius</h1>
<p> I absolutely love fire signs, I am a bit jealous of you guys. Traits of fire signs generally include: passion, creativity, spontaneity, and competitive spirit. </p>
<p2> Aries- generally, I really like Aries because they are passionate and love to live life to the fullest. I admire how they always have energy and will spotaneously do something. Aries are great people to do difficult things with, they are very headstrong, courageous, and not afraid to speak up. Recommended place to bring Aries: rallies/protests, confronting someone, sports event, etc. The one thing I don't like about Aries is that they can be too competitive, get angry too easily, or they can be insensitive.<p2>
<p3> Leo- You guys are strong, charismatic, and brave, similar to lions. You are also very warm and loving. I love leos! You are also often an incredibly good natural leader. And while you are by far one of my favorite signs, you can be self obsessed sometimes, which is a big flaw, especially as a person of the people. 
<p4> Sagittarius- You guys make excellent friends. You make people laugh, are crazy in a good/bad way, and extremely fun. Sagittariuses are the best to bring to large events or to hang out with, you are great with large groups but also in small ones too. Additionally, you guys are nice to talk to, you are approachable/friendly. A flaw is that soemtimes you can be very inconsistent, whether that is in relationships, school, mood, etc, and some of you are crazy. <p4>

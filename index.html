<h1>Katherine's Opinions on Astrological Signs</h1>
<p> Some people are really into zodiac signs, while others don't believe in them. I'm somewhere in between, but I thought it would be a fun topic to talk about. And by the way, do not take this personally, these opinions are generalizations. This website groups my thoughts on the signs into their four element categories, which are: </p>

</ul>
<li>Fire signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius)</li>
<li>Water signs (Virgo, Scorpio, Pisces)</li>
<li>Air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius)</li>
<li>Earth signs (Tarus,Cancer, Capricorn)</li>

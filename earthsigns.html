<h1>The Earth Signs- Taurus, Capricorn, Virgo</h1>
<p>  The Earth signs. Interesting. So, originally, I was not a huge earth sign fan because I thought they were a bit boring (no offense, sorry). But my perspective has changed a bit. The truth is that earth signs are very consistent and reliable, just like the earth. And I think that is really important in life. Earth signs are also generally slow to anger, down to earth (yup), and essential to balance out the other elements.</p>

<p3> Capricorn<br></p3>
<p4> Virgo- My favorite earth sign! You are excellent friends. Virgos are practical, sensible, loyal, etc. A stereotype is that you love plants? And I think that's cute. You are also very dedicated to whatever you are doing. Virgos are often classified as perfectionists who work to hard, and that is defintely the case for some. However, that doesn't apply to all virgos. Your weaknesses include neuroticism, hiding your feelings, living in your head, picky, and easily frustrated  <br></p4>

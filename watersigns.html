<h1>The Water Signs- Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces</h1>
<p> I also LOVE water signs, personally, I think you guys are very deep people, sometimes passive (not aggressive) /reserved and very emotional, althought it presents differently. Individually, I really love each of these signs, each for their own reasons. </p>
<p2> Cancer- Arguably one of the most distinct signs, I find you very outwardly emotional, kind, and sweet. You are extremely empathetic and nurturing. Your flaws are that sometimes because you are so sensitive, you sometimes can't take criticism well and you can pity yourself too much. But, you always seem to be like a parent and watch out for those you love. Also, everyone always knows how you're feeling</p2>
<p3> Scorpio- I love scorpios, and sometimes, like cancers, their traits can be overexaggerated in the media. However, like the media does say, you are serious. But, you aren't necessarily a dark person. You guys are extremely passionate and powerful people, and that can be daunting to someone who first meets you, but you care deeply. The one flaw is that you are really good and pushing things down and not showing your emotions, which can make it hard for someone to connect with you. Inside, you are deeply emotional.</p3>
<p4> Pisces- I see you similar to cancers in a way because you can be outwardly emotional, caring, and sensitive. But, you are also very optimistic and creative when it comes to life, art, expression, etc. Plus you are very forgiving and logical, you feel deeply but aren't necessarily guided by your emotions all the time. You guys can be a bit chaotic and afraid sometimes, also sometimes you can be very closed off.</p4>

<h1>The Air Signs- Gemini, Libra, Aquarius </h1>
<p> The Air Signs. Hmmmm. I can't say I'm crazy about them as a whole, but again, your zodiac sign doesn't make up who you fundamentally are. However, I do like that you are smart, you glide through life, have the ability to put emotions aside and make moral decisions, and you are sociable. </p>
<p2> Gemini- Hated by some and loved by others, Geminis are (very) outgoing, adaptable, and exciting. People are always talking about geminis because people often have strong feelings about them. I don't have super strong feelings about Gemini's, I think it is very dependent on the person. I think you are really good to have as classmates or friends, even if you aren't super close with them, because they are friendly and talkative. They are very entertaining, and they will bring zest to life. While this is true, geminis can be two faced and unreliable. </p2>
